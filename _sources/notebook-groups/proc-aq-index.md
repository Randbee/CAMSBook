# Data Processing

Data processing is a fundamental step in atmospheric science, involving the manipulation, analysis, and interpretation of raw data to extract meaningful information about atmospheric phenomena. In this section, we'll explore various data processing techniques commonly used in atmospheric research, focusing on specific applications and case studies.

## [Air Quality Index](../notebooks/proc-aq-index/proc-aq-index.ipynb)

This notebook provides you a practical introduction to the calculation and interpretation of the `Air Quality Index (AQI)` in Europe. Air pollution is the single largest environmental health risk in Europe, causing cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, that, in the most serious cases, lead to premature deaths.
The European Environment Agency's European Air Quality Index allows users to understand more about air quality where they live. Even though the air quality in Europe has improved over recent decades, the levels of air pollutants still exceed EU standards and the most stringent World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines.

## [Antarctic Ozone Hole Monitoring](../notebooks/proc-ozone/proc-ozone.ipynb)

This tutorial provides guided examples of ozone monitoring using data from the [Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS)](https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/). It is divided into two parts:

1. View animation of Antarctic ozone hole
2. Calculate the size of the Antarctic ozone hole

It uses CAMS global reanalysis (EAC4) data freely available from the [Atmosphere Data Store (ADS)](https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu)
